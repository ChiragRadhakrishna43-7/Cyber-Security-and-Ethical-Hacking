# Cyber-Security-and-Ethical-Hacking
Developed a project to demonstrate web application-penetration testing.

Utilised a virtual WordPress server for demonstrating penetration testing. Kali Linux and WPScan were used to obtain user accounts and passwords from the server. The vulnerabilities were exposed and highlighted.
Each stage of web application-penetration testing has been shown with great detail.

Was awarded outstanding project presentation by Mr. Altaf, Course Instructor, Cyber-Security-and-Ethical-Hacking Batch-18
